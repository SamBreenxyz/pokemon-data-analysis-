# Pokémon Data Analysis Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the **Pokémon dataset** through **Excel** and **Tableau**, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation. It demonstrates end-to-end analytical skills, from preparing raw data to producing interactive dashboards and summarised insights.  

The aim is to show how structured data analysis can be applied to a gaming dataset in order to uncover patterns in stats, categories, and combat potential.

## 🗂 Project Structure  
- **Excel Workbook**  
  - Data cleaning and preparation (structured tables, helper columns, conditional formatting).  
  - Analysis using formulas such as `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGEIF`, `SUMIF`, and `XLOOKUP`.  
  - Summary tables for categories and stat distributions.  
  - Charts and visuals for comparison across Pokémon types and categories.  

- **Tableau Dashboard**  
  - Interactive dashboard built on cleaned Pokémon data.  
  - Visuals highlighting:  
    - Distribution of Pokémon by Type and Category.  
    - Average stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) by Type.  
    - Comparative insights across Generations and Forms (Regular vs. Mega).  
  - Filters and interactivity for exploratory analysis.

## ⚙️ Tools Used  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, formula-driven analysis, pivot tables, and charts.  
- **Tableau Public** – Dashboard creation and interactive data visualisation.

## 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated  
- Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Formula-Based Analysis in Excel  
- Building Structured Tables with Data Validation  
- Pivot Tables & Summary Statistics  
- Dashboard Design & Visualisation in Tableau  
- Insight Communication  

---

## 📊 Sample Insights  
- Certain Pokémon Types consistently have higher **base Attack** or **HP**.  
- **Mega Evolutions** generally show significantly boosted stats compared to their regular forms.  
- Categories (e.g., Legendary, Mythical) display clear differences in combat potential when compared with standard Pokémon.
